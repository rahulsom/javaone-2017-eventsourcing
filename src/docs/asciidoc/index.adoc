Good afternoon everyone! My name is Rahul.
This talk is about Event Sourcing, JVM Languages and how they play with each other.
If you have a question, feel free to grab my attention; I'll do my best to answer it right away.

== About Me

[.step]
* Wanted Event Sourcing in 2016
* Didn't like anything I saw
* Built my own thing - Grooves
* I solve problems in Health Care

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Until mid 2015, I had never heard of the term event sourcing.
I learnt about it at a conference talk in Minneapolis, and the idea captivated my mind since then.

In early 2016, I was given a problem to solve, and after digging around, I felt that this would be a great place to use event sourcing.
So I started looking for libraries and frameworks that solved that problem.
Unfortunately, nothing worked for my specific problems.

So I did the next best thing - I wrote my own solution.
This talk will use that in examples, but most ideas are transferrable to other libraries.

Also, I work in Health Care.
That probably explains #2 on the list.

== Where I work

[.small]
Transcend Insights® empowers population health management with The Platform Above—technology that rises above the data silos and connects care teams with the insights they need to succeed in a value-based care world.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
I work for a company called Transcend Insights.
We traditionally dealt with _Health Information Exchange_ and _Health data analytics_.

We wanted to get into data warehousing and reporting.
That's where we ended up using event sourcing.

Our raw data is very different from IOT, Banking, and Retail.
They have thousands of events a second, with payloads typically in a few kilobytes.
We have tens of events a second, at best, and ridiculously large payloads.
100s of kb to 10s of Mb is fairly common.
Occasionally we go up to a few Gb of data.

[NOTE.speaker]

Let's do a show of hands.

How many of you use Java as your primary language for writing code?

Groovy?

Kotlin?

Others?

My examples are targeted towards Java, Groovy and Kotlin, but if it works with these languages, it should work with most languages.

== What is Event Sourcing

> Treat your database like you treat your application logs

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Almost everyone produces application logs.
Most of us debug other people's applications using logs.
Some of us audit the application using application logs.
--

=== What does that mean

Create

Read

[line-through]#Update#

[line-through]#Delete#

[NOTE.speaker]
--
I think this was spotted early on in Jonas Bonér's slide decks.
It beautifully represents what we need to be doing.
Sometimes you'll have legal requirements to remove data, i.e. offer consumers a right to be forgotten.
--

[background-color="darkred"]
== Bad Example 1

Mark and Jane share a bank account.
The account has a balance of $75.
Mark goes to an ATM and withdraws $50.
At the same time Jane attempts to withdraw $50.

This is what our code looks like

[source,java]
----
@Transactional
boolean withdraw(String accountNumber, double amount) {
  double balance = accountService.getBalance(accountNumber);
  if (balance > amount) {
    balance -= account;
    accountService.setBalance(accountNumber, balance);
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
----

++++
<script>$('#slide-bad-example-1 pre').attr('data-line', '1');</script>
++++

[NOTE.speaker]
--
A lot of text books and tutorials teach transaction management this way.
Adding `@Transactional` is what they recommend.
Actually, they teach you to start and stop transactions manually.
I would have done that, but then it wouldn't fit on a slide.

However, this is not how banks deal with transactions.
And they've been dealing with transactions since before computers were a thing.

Also I'm using `double` for `amount` instead of using `BigDecimal`.
This is also to make the slide concise.
--

=== What banks typically do

--

[NOTE.speaker]
--
This is what banks typically do.
I could only find an example in German, but if you're old enough, you've seen one.
If not, welcome to the 80's.
And this is not new, it's something banks have done for 100s of years.

The columns we see there are

* timestamp
* description
* credit
* debit
* balance
* authorization

This is beautiful.

You can always look at the last line with balance and know how much money you have before writing a check.
And if you think the transactions don't add up, you can manually check that they've done calculations correctly.
--

=== But that was _Banking_

[.fragment]
If you can look at your logs and debug your application, you are already doing that.

[.fragment]
Banks defined their business model this way hundreds of years ago.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
If you are looking at application logs to confirm or deny that there is a bug, you are actually a human that's performing event sourcing on your logs.
I've done that. Several times.

Banks have trained you to debug their logs.
It's pure genius.
Getting the customer who has no access to source code, to debug the application...

If banks can do that, you can do that.
It could be a little harder, but not impossible.
But if you succeed at doing that, the benefits are huge.
--

=== What about my domain?

[cols=3]
|===
a| [source,java]
----
/* Aggregate */
class Account {
  String accountNumber;
}
----
a| [source,java]
----
/* Events */
abstract class Transaction {
  Account account;
}
class AtmWithdrawal
    extends Transaction {
  String location;
  double amount;
}
class AtmDeposit
    extends Transaction {
  String location;
  double amount;
}
----
a| [source,java]
----
/* Snapshot */
class AccountSummary {
  double balance;
}
----
|===

[NOTE.speaker]
--
So this is what a bank does.
You can clearly split this into 3 types of domain classes.
And if you try to do something similar to your domain, you can get a similar domain model too.
--

=== What about my domain?

[cols=3]
|===
a| [source,java]
----
/* Aggregate */
class Patient {
  String identifier;
  String system;
}
----
a| [source,java]
----
/* Events */
abstract class PatientEvent {
  Patient patient;
}
class MedicationPrescribed
    extends PatientEvent {
  String code;
  int quantity;
}
class ProcedurePerformed
    extends PatientEvent {
  String code;
}
----
a| [source,java]
----
/* Snapshot */
class PatientSummary {
  List<String> medications;
  List<String> procedures;
}
----
|===

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Here, I've replaced all banking related models with some Health Care related models.
--

=== Computing Snapshots

[stem]
++++
S_N = f(S_0 , E_1..E_N)
++++

[cols=">1a,4"]
|===
| asciimath:[S_N]        |  Snapshot at Version N
| asciimath:[S_0]        |  empty snapshot
| asciimath:[E_1..E_N]   |  events from position 1 through N
| asciimath:[f]          |  query
|===

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Here's the mathematics that needs to work correctly for Event Sourcing to work.

Let's assume the N-th version of the snapshot is what we want to compute.

The empty snapshot in banking is a zero balance account.
In our health care example, it would be a patient with no medications and no procedures.

We will be applying each event from position 1 through N, one at a time.
For each event, given the _before_ state of the snapshot, you should be able to compute the _after_ state.

That computation is what we call the _query_.
--

[background-color="darkred"]
== But it's not that simple

[NOTE.speaker]
--
If you've seen a business checking account, you'll know that it's possible to have hundreds of transactions in a day.
It's not feasible to keep computing the balance everytime you need to know the snapshot at version N.
--

=== Incremental Computation

This is what we would like to do

[stem]
++++
S_N = f(S_K , E_(K+1)..E_N)
++++

In Mathematics, it's called the distributive property

[stem]
++++
a+b+c = (a+b) +c
++++

[NOTE.speaker]
--
If we've got a partial computation and we can persist it, we would like to reuse it.
In Mathematics, it's called the distributive property.
--

[background-color="darkred"]
=== We're not done yet

There are special events

=== Revert

image::https://rahulsom.github.io/grooves/manual/0.2.0/RevertEvent.svg[]

[.fragment]
image::https://rahulsom.github.io/grooves/manual/0.2.0/RevertEventEffective.svg[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Mistakes happen.
All the time.
Users might fat finger something on your UI.
Or another application might have a bug.
Or you might allow reversal of charges as a business policy.

Regardless of why you do this, you'll want to support reverts.
In this example, we have events 1-4.
Then someone realizes that 3 was a mistake.
You never want to remove 3.
So what you do is, you create 5 that says, "forget 3 ever happened".
When computing snapshots the system will behave as if 3 never happened.
However when auditing the system, it will behave as if 3 and 5 both happened.
There isn't much value to this when only looking at balances in a bank account.
However, this can change a whole lot of things when dealing with more complex domains.
--

=== Revert Again

image::https://rahulsom.github.io/grooves/manual/0.2.0/RevertOnRevert.svg[]

[.fragment]
image::https://rahulsom.github.io/grooves/manual/0.2.0/RevertOnRevertEffective.svg[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Any event in your system can be reverted.
This means that a revert event can also be reverted.

In this example, 6 reverts 5.
That means 5 cannot revert 3 anymore.

Reverts actually are applied in reverse order.
That makes things like this possible.
--

=== Merge/Deprecate

image::https://rahulsom.github.io/grooves/manual/0.2.0/MergeAggregates.svg[]

[.fragment]
image::https://rahulsom.github.io/grooves/manual/0.2.0/MergeAggregatesEffective.svg[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
In some domains, it's uncommon to create a new aggregate in a hurry.
In Health care, for example, it is extremely common.
It's more important to provide health care than it is to find the right record and keep your database clean.

So in our example now we have 2 aggregates that actually represent the same patient.
Once we realize that it's the same person, we need to convince the system to sort out the timeline and remove the duplicate.

6 tells you that Freddie is deprecated by the long standing record of Farrokh.
7 tells you that when computing Farrokh's snapshot, you should pay attention to events in Freddie's timeline as well.
--

=== Reverting a Merge

image::https://rahulsom.github.io/grooves/manual/0.2.0/RevertMergeBefore.svg[]

[.fragment]
image::https://rahulsom.github.io/grooves/manual/0.2.0/RevertMergeAfter.svg[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Oh, and these events can be merged too.
You want to be careful enough to revert both events at the same time.
--

[background-color="darkred"]

|===

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Here's another textbook example that I think is bad.
Here's your favorite star trek characters and their departments shown in our tables.
We are using a foreign key to point us to the right department.

This does not always work correctly.
Let's look how we would solve this in an event sourced system for a simple case first.
--

=== Joins in Event Sourcing

image::https://rahulsom.github.io/grooves/manual/0.2.0/JoinExample.svg[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Scotty is more of a one trick pony.
So all we need is an event in Scotty's timeline that tells us he's now in Engineering.
And another in Engineering's timeline that tells Scotty has joined.

Nothing magical about this.
--

=== Disjoins too

image::https://rahulsom.github.io/grooves/manual/0.2.0/DisjoinExample.svg[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Mr Spock on the other hand, is very special.
He started off as a Science officer.
Then he became Captain.
In one episode, he was an admiral.
The Star Trek wiki tells me he's now Federation Ambassador.

When he moved from Science to Command, our textbook example would stop working.
We need to preserve this information in a usable way.
--

== Grooves Domain Objects

=== Aggregates

[source,java]
----
public class Patient implements AggregateType<Long> {
    private Long id;
    private String uniqueId;
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
This assumes your natural id is separate from your primary key.

If you don't need a separate natural id, good for you.
All you need then is the `id`.

The type of `id` goes into the generic type param of `AggregateType`.
--

=== Events

[source,java]
----
public abstract class PatientEvent implements
        BaseEvent<Long, Patient, Long, PatientEvent> {
    private Patient aggregate;
    private Long id;
    private String createdBy;
    private RevertEvent<Long, Patient, Long, PatientEvent> revertedBy;
    private Date timestamp;
    private Long position;

    @Override
    @NotNull
    public Observable<Patient> getAggregateObservable() {
        return aggregate != null ? just(aggregate) : empty();
    }
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
This is a base class for all events that we'll be applying on `Patient`.
All these properties are required to make Grooves happy.

`createdBy` is where we'll put in some information on the authorization.

`revertedBy` is going to be transient from a database perspective.
That will allow us to build an audit ui that tells us why a certain event was reverted.
It will point to a Revert Event.

`timestamp` and `position` are going to help us work with a timeline.
Sometimes we need to look at the time of an event.
Sometimes we just care about the position of an event.

The position is interesting, in that it could be global, or it could be specific to an aggregate.

If you make it global, you can answer questions about the state of the whole system.
That works a bit like SVN used to work for versioning code.

If you make it local, then it works more locally, but it can then be used for optimistic locking.
You can try to do optimistic locking with global positioning, but the effects on scalability might not be good.

You'll notice that the type params are already getting long, and they will continue to get longer as we work on queries.
So I'll skip type parameters occasionally here.
If you end up using grooves, the documentation will guide you on them.
--

=== Real Events

[source,java]
----
public class PatientCreated extends PatientEvent {
    private String name;
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
This is our first real event.
All this does for us is let us set the name for the patient at the time of creation.
--

=== Special Events

[source,java]
----
public class PatientEventReverted
        extends PatientEvent
        implements RevertEvent<Long, Patient, Long, PatientEvent> {
    private Long revertedEventId;
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
At some point you will want to support the special events.
We'll take revert as an example.
Each special event has its own interface, and demands some properties be there.
Some properties will replace the getter with RxJava Observables.
--

=== Snapshots

[source,java]
----
public class PatientAccount
        implements JavaSnapshot<Long, Patient, Long, Long, PatientEvent>,
        Serializable {
    private Long id;
    private Patient aggregate;
    private Patient deprecatedBy;
    private List<Patient> deprecates = new ArrayList<>();
    private Long lastEventPosition;
    private Date lastEventTimestamp;

    private String name;
    private BigDecimal balance = new BigDecimal(0);
    private BigDecimal moneyMade = new BigDecimal(0);

    public Observable<Patient> getAggregateObservable() {
        return just(aggregate);
    }

    public Observable<Patient> getDeprecatedByObservable() {
        return just(deprecatedBy);
    }

    public Observable<Patient> getDeprecatesObservable() {
        return from(deprecates);
    }
}
----

++++
<script>$('#slide-snapshots pre').attr('data-line', '11-13');</script>
++++

[NOTE.speaker]
--
In this case, we're looking at a snapshot of a patient that will tell us how much is owed by the patient, and how much money has been made.
Pretty simple: The highlighted portions show us those properties.
The rest is to make Grooves happy.

`deprecatedBy` tells you if the aggregate that this snapshot represents has been deprecated by another aggregate.
Think of the Freddie Mercury and Farokh Bulsara example.

`deprecates` tells you of all the aggregates that were deprecated by the aggregate of this snapshot.
That helps you look up the deprecated ones to see if you need to include any event in your computation.

If you're just computing bank balances, it's easy.
If you're doing something complex like looking at multiple medications and deciding if something needs to be done for a patient, you can't take shortcuts.
--

== Grooves Queries

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Next up, lets look at what it takes to write a query.
In our mathematical representation, it was a simple function called `f`.
--

=== Satisfying grooves

[source,java]
----
public class PatientAccountQuery<...> extends QuerySupport<...> {
    ...
}
----

Could also be `VersionedQuerySupport` or `TemporalQuerySupport`

[NOTE.speaker]
--
I'm assuming for this part that you might do either kind of query, i.e. by timestamp or by position.
The position is only for events. Once it becomes a snapshot, we'll call it a version.

If you know that you'll only do one kind, you could reduce how much code you need to write.
--

=== Fetching snapshots

[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public PatientAccount createEmptySnapshot() {
        return new PatientAccount();
    }

    @Override
    public Observable<PatientAccount> getSnapshot(
            long maxPosition, Patient aggregate) {
        ...
    }

    @Override
    public Observable<PatientAccount> getSnapshot(
            Date maxTimestamp, Patient aggregate) {
        ...
    }
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
First off we'll have to get the query to be able to do 3 things

* Produce an empty snapshot; this is like a zero balance account in banking, or a patient with no medications or procedures in our case.
* Find a snapshot that was computed and persisted earlier in the database.
 ** This could be done by a max position, i.e. find a snapshot older or equal to the desired version.
 That way we can optionally add more events to it.
 ** Or it could be done by a max timestamp. Same thing more or less.
--

=== Fetching events

[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public Observable<PatientEvent> getUncomputedEvents(
            Patient aggregate, PatientAccount lastSnapshot, long version) {

    }

    @Override
    public Observable<PatientEvent> getUncomputedEvents(
            Patient aggregate, PatientAccount lastSnapshot, Date snapshotTime) {

    }
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Next up, we'll find events that occur between a previous snapshot, and the desired version or timestamp.
Once we find these events, we can then apply them one after another.
--

=== Handling errors

[source,java]
----
    @Override
    default Observable<EventApplyOutcome> onException(
            Exception e, PatientAccount snapshot, PatientEvent event) {
        getLog().error("Error computing snapshot", e);
        return just(CONTINUE);
    }
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Sometimes your code can throw exceptions.
If it does, we need a place to catch these exceptions and decide what to do.
We might just take the simplest path and log the exception and abort the computation for this snapshot.

Or, you could collect all the exceptions, and then present them to the user in a simpler form.
This way, you can tell the user that you tried to do your best, but that wasn't good enough.

So, though you can present them with a snapshot, they should take it with a grain of salt.

You might not want to do that for a financial transaction, but if you're doing something for health care, this is much better than an error message.
The doctor can look your condition, and the warning, and then ask the patient, "Hey, you've got high blood pressure, but I don't see your blood pressure medication. Are you taking one? Let me fix the record here..."
--

=== Processing events

For languages like Java, Groovy

[source,java]
----
    public Observable<EventApplyOutcome> applyPatientCreated(
            PatientCreated event, PatientAccount snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.getAggregate() == event.getAggregate()) {
            snapshot.setName(event.getName());
        }
        return just(CONTINUE);
    }

    ...
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
So we're going to assume your jvm language is very much like java.
This works for groovy too.

You can write a method based on the event name that applies the event to a snapshot.
Then it returns the outcome in an observable.

This needs to be done only for user events.
Special events will not come here at all, which makes sense.
The reason those events are special is they can be made to work in any domain.
What good is a library if it doesn't handle those for you.

It's a bit of a problem, in that your compiler won't tell you if you've covered all event types.
--

=== Processing events

For languages with case classes

[source,kotlin]
----
    override fun applyEvent(
        event: PatientEvent.Applicable, snapshot: PatientAccount) =
            when (event) {
                is PatientEvent.Applicable.Created -> {
                    // Your logic here
                    just(CONTINUE)
                }
                is PatientEvent.Applicable.ProcedurePerformed -> {
                    // Your logic here
                    just(CONTINUE)
                }
                is PatientEvent.Applicable.PaymentMade -> {
                    // Your logic here
                    just(CONTINUE)
                }
            }
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
If you're using something like kotlin or scala, where you've got case classes or sealed classes, you can do this.
This example is in Kotlin, and uses a when statement as a method expression.

Now the compiler will error out if you miss out on some subclass of your events.
--

=== Events

For languages with case classes

[source,kotlin]
----
sealed class PatientEvent : BaseEvent<..> {
    // Properties and methods from equivalent java class

    sealed class Applicable : PatientEvent() {
        data class Created(val name: String) : Applicable()
        data class ProcedurePerformed(
                val code: String, val cost: Double) : Applicable()
        ..
    }

    data class Reverted(override val revertedEventId: String) :
            PatientEvent(), RevertEvent<..>
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Of course, you need to write your events using sealed classes.
This is great for Kotlin and Scala.
But what about Java and Groovy?
--

=== Completeness for Java

...and Groovy.

[source,java]
----
@Aggregate public class Patient {...}
public abstract class PatientEvent {}

@Event(Patient.class)
public class ProcedurePerformed extends PatientEvent {}
@Event(Patient.class)
public class PaymentMade extends PatientEvent {}

@Query(aggregate=Patient.class, snapshot=PatientAccount.class)
public class PatientAccountQuery {
    ...
    Observable<EventApplyOutcome> applyProcedurePerformed() {...}
    Observable<EventApplyOutcome> applyPaymentMade() {...}
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Java as well as groovy allow you to customize compilation a little bit.

Java uses Annotation Processors, Groovy uses AST Transformations.

With a few annotations, you can verify completeness at compile time.

Downsides? IDE support. Custom plugins?
--

== Gotchas

[NOTE.speaker]
--
This is my favorite part of this presentation.

Some of these are things I wish I knew before I started exploring this space.

Before we go into details, does anyone want to answer the question?

I don't see anyone in the hall wearing lycra or leaning their bikes against the wall.
So let's look at the raw data and see if we can answer the question.

How many Tour de France victories did Lance have on this day, 10 years ago?

The victories are represented by the yellow jersey in the table.

* Is the answer 7?
* Is the answer 0?
* Is there any other answer?

Well, the fact that we have more than one answer that seems correct means, that the question is wrong.

And what's worse is, we've let our users look at the same inputs as our software and now they are convinced our software is broken.

So let's fix the problem.

There are in fact two different questions.
Now, I hope we have consistent answers.

=== Advice on handling data

* Be very careful about what your events look like.
* Don't worry much about what your snapshots look like.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
What I learnt was, that we need to be very careful when getting new kinds of data into the system.
Mistakes made there are very hard to correct.

Mistakes in processing data are relatively easy to correct.

=== Communication is key

++++
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">95% of the cost of event sourcing projects is explaining event sourcing</p>&mdash; Scott Bellware (@sbellware) <a href="https://twitter.com/sbellware/status/873723025472016384">June 11, 2017</a></blockquote>

Having detailed documentation on what your aggregates, events and snapshots are, really helps.

In the early days, we used tables and json and what not to communicate what we expected in our aggregates and events.

Later on we switched to using diagrams like the ones I used in this presentation.
This reduced the overhead of having to talk to several developers from many teams about what we were doing.
People just began to understand from our diagrams.

=== Non Event Sources of data

When the intent of the user is not clear from the datasource.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
One problem my team faced was data was not always event based.
So some system would always expose their current state as an API or a file export.
And we would have to read that and figure out what to do.

Should we break down the entire resource from this source into small atomic events?
Should we treat the whole thing as one giant event?

In the end, we decided to do different things for different kinds of sources.
It's very hard to find out what's _just right_ for a problem.
But it's worth the trial and error if you have that luxury to find what's best.

Before I open the floor for the last questions, I would like to thank you all for coming here today.
If you go to those two urls under github, you can find the slides or the library I've created for solving these problems.

If you're interested in learning more about event sourcing, 2017 is a great year at Java One for Event Sourcing.
There are 5 other talks that have Event Sourcing or CQRS in their abstract.

Once again, thank you! And I hope you have a great time at Java One.
